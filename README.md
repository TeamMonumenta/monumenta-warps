# Monumenta Warps

Simple Bukkit/Spigot plugin adding "warps" (teleport locations). Also adds
/back and /forward, which can be used multiple times to move back and forth
between teleport locations.

This is much nicer than similar functionality in Essentials, which doesn't
support multiple chaining /back locations (only one), and doesn't have
/forward. There are a number of other small useful features like tab complete,
etc.

You can download Monumenta Warps from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/TeamMonumenta/monumenta-warps/packages).
This is automatically updated every time new changes are made. Click on the
com.playmonumenta.monumenta... link, and download the .jar file from the
"Assets" category on the right side of the page.

Optionally integrates with the [Monumenta World Management](https://github.com/TeamMonumenta/monumenta-world-management)
plugin to support cross-world warps, automatically loading warp target worlds if they are unloaded.
